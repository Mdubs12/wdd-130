      <p>
        Welcome to Mitchell Wilwand's portfolio site. Whether you're a potential employer or customer, you'll find everything 
        you need to know, right here. 

        I am a software developer with a bachelor's degree in software engineering from Brigham Young University Idaho. My 
        main passion is for coding, although I also studied web development and cybersecurity. I 
        
        On this site you will find all the different projects I've worked on, I hope they can show you the dedication and care I put
        into my work. You will also find a resume page which details my entire work history. This page will include information on
        all the jobs I've worked before in a simple format, along with references from past employers.

      </ul>
      <h3>Past projects</h3>
      <p>
        This is a page of projects that I have worked on or made myself. This page will be constantly updated and filled with
        new projects as I get more oppurtunities to learn and improve my skills.

        <img src="images/Past_projectsedited_50.png" alt="White water rafitng site">
        This is one of the websites I made in college, it's a white water rafting website with fully functioning links and pages. 
        This project taught me a lot of the basics of building a website, like how to code in html, and how to design and add style
        in CSS. It also taught me about actual style for webpages and how to make designs that catch people's eyes and draw attention. 
        <img src="images/dice.jpg" alt="Dice App">
        As a project in school, I made a phone app that can simulate rolling dice. As a fan of TTRPGs, I was disappointed in the 
        lack of options for a dice-rolling app, and so I made my own. This is an example of how I can see when there is a need for 
        something new.

      <h3>Resume</h3>

        This is my resume page, I'll let it speak for itself.

        <img src="images/Eagle_scout.jpg" alt="Eagle scout">
        This is a picture of when I received my 'Eagle Scout', it was something that took a long time and a lot of work. Even 
        though the skills I learned while getting my eagle scout aren't applicable in my field of work, I think this shows 
        my dedication to finish my goals and long-term projects.
